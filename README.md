## My process
Started with setting up the HTML first, and from there I added the colors with CSS variables, and the layout using Flexbox.
Made the desktop version first and then adjusted the mobile view, should I have done it again I would have started with the mobile view.
After the card was made, I refactored as much of the code as possible to clean up and make the code more readable, especially because I added `display:flex;` on too many elements to start with.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
